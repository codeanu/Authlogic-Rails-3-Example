# Authlogic Rails 3 Example

All the examples for Authlogic I found seemed to not be written with Rails 3 in mind. So here's my simple example of setting up a basic Rails 3 app with Authlogic.

Also uses some other trendy Ruby stuff including:

* [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber)
* [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl)

## 0. Pre-requisites

You have a useable Rails environment. That is you can run

    $ gem install authlogic
    $ rails new my_app

and it does its stuff.
